# MATLAB Function: Incorrect Empty Input Handling

This repository demonstrates a common bug in MATLAB functions: incorrect handling of empty input. The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that attempts to sum elements of a vector but fails to handle the case where the input vector is empty.

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function that gracefully handles empty input.

## Bug Description

The original `myFunction.m` does not explicitly check for an empty input vector. When called with an empty vector, it results in an error or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` adds a check for an empty input vector. If the input is empty, the function returns 0, representing the sum of an empty set. Otherwise, it proceeds with calculating the sum using the `sum()` function.

This example highlights the importance of robust input validation and error handling in MATLAB functions to prevent unexpected results and crashes.
